# Synchronised Bingo Boards for Multiplayer Speedrun Races

Bingo Speedrun is a web application for collaborative bingo boards used in multiplayer races.

You can create rooms, and other players can join your room using your room code. Each room has a bingo board with a goal listed on each tile. When you complete a goal, click on the tile to mark it with your colour, and it is synchronised between all other players in the room.

The win condition is up to you. For example, you can end the game when one player gets a full line, or until a player controls the entire board.
